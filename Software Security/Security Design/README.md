differences between bugs and flaws
==================================
* both **bugs** and **flaws** are types of defects
* a **bug** is an implementation-level software problem (a bug may exist in code but never be executed). examples of bugs:
  * an off by-one error in an array reference
  * an incorrect system call
* a **flaw**, by contrast, is the result of a mistake or oversight at the design level. examples of flaws:
  * placing authorization, access control, enforcement of security policy, or embedded sensitive data in client software thinking that it wonâ€™t be discovered, modified, or exposed by clever users or malicious attackers
