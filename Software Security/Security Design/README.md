Bugs and Flaws
==============
* Both **bugs** and **flaws** are types of defects.
* A **bug** is an implementation-level software problem (a bug may exist in code but never be executed).
Typical examples of bugs are:
  * An off by-one error in an array reference.
  * An incorrect system call.
* A **flaw**, by contrast, is the result of a mistake or oversight at the design level. Typical examples of flaws:
  * Placing authorization, access control, enforcement of security policy, or embedded sensitive data in client software thinking that it wonâ€™t be discovered, modified, or exposed by clever users or malicious attackers.
  * Poorly designed authentication mechanisms.
  * Lack of strict separation between data and code.
